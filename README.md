ATM Machine Operation is a software application designed to simulate the real-time functioning of an Automated Teller Machine used in banks. The project enables users to log in securely using an ATM card number and Personal Identification Number (PIN). After successful authentication, users can perform various banking operations such as cash withdrawal, balance enquiry, and viewing mini statements. The system checks account balance and validates user details with the bank database before processing any transaction. This project helps in understanding core banking operations, security mechanisms, and user interaction in ATM systems.
